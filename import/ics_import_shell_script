# If your events can be exported from the external calendar system into
# an iCal (.ics) file, you may use a command-line script like this to import
# them into Trumba via curl:


curl --silent http://localhost/tools/events/$TRUMBA_CALNAME.ics | \
 curl --silent --user "$TRUMBA_USERNAME:$TRUMBA_PASSWORD" --upload-file - "https://www.trumba.com/service/$TRUMBA_CALNAME.ics" \
  > /dev/null
